**How to Compile and Run**

To compile and run these C++ programs, you will need a C++ compiler like g++. You can compile each program using the following command:
" g++ -o AssignmentX AssignmentX.cpp "

Replace X with the assignment number. To run the compiled program, use:
" ./AssignmentX "

**Prerequisites**

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Basic understanding of C++ and programming concepts
